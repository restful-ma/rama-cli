# RAML Parser

The RAML parser was implemented using the [raml-java-parser](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-java-parser) and parses RAML v1.0 specifications into Java objects. These objects are then converted into our internal model. Using this method, most of the relevant parts could be parsed within a single step by simply calling `getName()` or similar methods. This was, however, not possible for the properties of the request bodies and the responses. To parse this information, we had to parse the XMLSchema data that the `raml-java-parser` provides for all objects. This added an additional step into the parsing process of the properties.

# OpenAPI V3 Parser

The [KaiZen-OpenApi-Parser](https://github.com/RepreZen/KaiZen-OpenApi-Parser) is used to parse OpenAPI v3 files, as it is simple to use and supports all features necessary for our internal data model. OpenAPI v2 a.k.a as Swagger is NOT supported, but such files can be converted to v3 using a tool like [swagger2openapi](https://github.com/Mermade/oas-kit/blob/master/packages/swagger2openapi/README.md).

# WADL Parser

To develop this parser, the definition schema of [WADL](https://www.w3.org/Submission/wadl/wadl.xsd) was used to generate a JAXB model. During file parsing, an exhaustive in-between POJO model is created. This model is the basis for the transformation to the internal model. In case of changes to the internal model, the in-between model does not need to change, as it already contains all data and adjustments available in the transformation. Given the lack of a formal representation and the impossibility of correctly parsing every unknown input, we opted to create a base schema for representations and requiring these to be present in the parsed file. This schema definition was created by querying many files for their used elements. Afterwards, another JAXB model was generated based on this schema. Thereby, maintainability can be retained, because changes of this schema can be quickly converted to new code.

 Both schema definitions are included in the project at `src/main/resources/specification/wadl`. While we used the [IntelliJ IDEA integrated tool](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/generating-java-code-from-xml-schema.html) to generate Java files from the schema definitions, other possibilities exist. Eclipse offers [equivalent functionality](http://help.eclipse.org/mars/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jpt.doc.user%2Ftask_generate_classes_from_schema.htm). Creation can also be automated with the [JAXB2 Maven plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/jaxb2-maven-plugin/Documentation/v2.2/) or be performed [manually](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11463312) using the `xjc -d generated PATHTOXSD` command of the Java compiler (XJC) included in the JDK.
